# Description

This repository serves as a playground. My goal in creating it was to spin up a node.js server (using express.js) as well as a React client from scratch.

In a production environment, I would not keep the client and the server in the same repo, they would instead be two seperate repos.

## How to Run this Application
  1. Follow the steps in "How to run the Server" below
  2. Follow to steps in "How to run the client" below
  3. Open the website via `http://localhost:1234`

## How to run the Server
  * After cloning this repo, cd into the `/api` folder and install the npm dependencies via `npm install`
  * While in the `/api` folder, start the server by running `npm run start` (This "start" command was created for you and is defined in `api/package.json`)

## How to run the client
  * After cloning this repo, cd into the `/client` folder and install the npm dependencies via `npm install`
  * While in the `/client` folder, start the webapp by running `npm run start` (This "start" command was created for you and is defined in `client/package.json`)
