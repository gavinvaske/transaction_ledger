# Description

This repository serves as a playground. My goal in creating it was to spin up a node.js server (using express.js) as well as a React client from scratch.

In a production environment, I would not keep the client and the server in the same repo, they would instead be two seperate repos.

## How to run the client
  * After cloning this repo, cd into the /client folder and install the npm dependencies via `npm install`
  * Start the server by running `npm run start` (This "start" command was created for you and is defined in `package.json`)
